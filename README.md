## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Bun installed on your system. You can check by running:


```bash
bun --version
```
If Bun is not installed, follow the instructions on the [official Bun website](https://bun.sh/) to set it up.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aetherjs/mentalmath.git
```
Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using Bun:

```bash
bun install
```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run several commands using Bun:

`bun run dev` Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

`bun run build` Builds the app for production to the dist folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

`bun run preview` After building the app, you can use this command to locally preview the production build.

You can use `bunx` instead of npx to execute init scripts and such.
